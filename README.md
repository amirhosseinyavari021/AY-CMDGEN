CMDGEN - Your Intelligent Command-Line Assistant
CMDGEN is a smart web-based tool designed to help developers, system administrators, and new users work effortlessly with the command line. This project was created to simplify the complex processes of generating, explaining, and scripting terminal commands.

This project was created by Amirhossein Yavari, a young ITman and ITlover and ITlearner passionate about IT and building useful, practical tools.

‚ú® Key Features
CMDGEN offers three core, powerful features to its users:

Generate Commands:

Describe your needs in plain English or Persian (e.g., "how to find and delete all log files larger than 100MB?").

CMDGEN understands your request and provides accurate, real-world command-line instructions with clear explanations.

It also includes a feature to request more command variations for the same query.

Explain Commands:

Enter any command-line instruction that is unclear to you.

CMDGEN breaks it down into smaller parts and explains each component in simple, easy-to-understand language.

This feature is excellent for deeply learning commands and understanding their functionality.

Create Scripts:

Describe a task you want to automate (e.g., "write a script that backs up my database and compresses it").

CMDGEN generates a complete, clean, and executable script (in sh, bat, or ps1 format) for you.

The generated scripts include error handling and prerequisite checks to ensure they run reliably.

Error Analysis:

If you run a command and encounter an error, you can paste the error message into this section.

CMDGEN will explain the probable cause of the error and provide step-by-step solutions to fix it.

üöÄ Technology Stack
This project is built with a modern and efficient technology stack:

Frontend (Client):

React: For building a dynamic and modern user interface.

Lucide React: For beautiful and lightweight icons.

Axios: For making API requests to the server.

Framer Motion: For creating engaging animations.

Backend (Server):

Node.js: The server-side runtime environment.

Express.js: The web framework for building the API.

Artificial Intelligence (AI):

The project connects to Large Language Models (LLMs) via a proxy server through OpenRouter.ai to generate intelligent and accurate responses.

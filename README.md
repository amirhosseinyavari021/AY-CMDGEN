Generate, analyze, script, and debug command-line instructions with an AI-powered assistant, right in your terminal.

CMDGEN is a smart, cross-platform tool that bridges the gap between natural language and the command line. Whether you're a seasoned sysadmin, a developer, or just starting out, CMDGEN helps you master the terminal with ease. This project features both a powerful Command-Line Tool (CLI) and a user-friendly Web Application.

üéâ What's New in Version 2.6.5 ‚Äì Debug Flag & Performance Improvements & installing and updating bug fixed

This version introduces a new `--debug` flag for optional detailed logging, conditional parser logs for reduced console clutter, and overall code optimizations for better maintainability and efficiency.

New Features:
- üîç **Debug Flag**: Added `--debug` option to enable detailed `[PARSER]` logs for troubleshooting parser behavior. Use it with any command, e.g., `cmdgen generate "list files" --debug`.
- üìä **Conditional Logging**: Parser logs now only appear when `--debug` is enabled, improving performance and user experience in normal usage.

Changes & Improvements:
- üõ†Ô∏è **Code Quality Enhancements**: Streamlined variable naming, added more comments, and optimized logging logic in `responseParser-cli.js` for better readability and efficiency.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Performance Optimizations**: Reduced unnecessary console outputs in non-debug mode, making the CLI faster and cleaner.
- üìà **Help Menu Update**: Added `--debug` to the help menu for easier discovery.

These build on v2.6.0's logging system, making debugging more flexible while keeping the tool lightweight.

üöÄ Quick Install (Recommended)

The installation script automatically detects your OS, downloads the correct version, and sets it up for you.

‚ö†Ô∏è Administrator Privileges Required cmdgen requires administrator/root privileges for global installation. Global installations write files into system directories (e.g., /usr/local/bin on macOS/Linux or Program Files on Windows). These locations are protected, so elevated permissions are needed.

Why it matters: Without admin privileges, installation may fail with "permission denied" errors or the program may not be accessible globally.

How to Install

For macOS / Linux:
- Using NPM (recommended for Node.js users):
  ```
  sudo npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
  ```
- Using the installation script (requires sudo):
  ```
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.sh | sudo bash
  ```

For Windows:
- Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí Run as Administrator).
- Install via NPM:
  ```
  npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
  ```
- Or using the installation script:
  ```
  iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.ps1 | iex
  ```

‚úÖ Tip for Users Without Admin Rights If you cannot run commands with sudo (macOS/Linux) or as Administrator (Windows), you can still use cmdgen without installing it globally by using npx.
npx is included with Node.js and allows you to run npm packages temporarily, without writing files to system directories, so admin privileges are not required.

Example:
```
npx @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen generate "list all files in system"
```

This runs the command directly without a global installation.

After Installation Open a new terminal window to start using cmdgen.
Verify the installation by running:
```
cmdgen 
```

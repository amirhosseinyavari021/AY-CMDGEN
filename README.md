Generate, analyze, script, and debug command-line instructions with an AI-powered assistant, right in your terminal.

CMDGEN is a smart, cross-platform tool that bridges the gap between natural language and the command line. Whether you're a seasoned sysadmin, a developer, or a network engineer, CMDGEN helps you master the terminal with ease. This project features both a powerful Command-Line Tool (CLI) and a user-friendly Web Application.

üéâ **What's New in Version 2.7.1 ‚Äì Intelligent, Context-Aware, and Stable**

This version represents a complete overhaul of AY-CMDGEN, focusing on new intelligent features, critical bug fixes, and a dramatic increase in the quality of AI-generated output. The tool is now more context-aware, stable, and valuable for users of all skill levels.

**1. Major Feature Enhancements**

  - üß† **Full Cisco Support**: CMDGEN is now a powerful tool for network engineers. Select **Cisco** as a platform in both the web and CLI versions to generate, script, analyze, and debug commands.
  - **Device-Specific Context**: When Cisco is selected, the tool asks for the **Device Type** (Router, Switch, Firewall) to provide highly accurate and relevant commands.
  - üéì **Contextual Intelligence via Knowledge Level**: A new **Knowledge Level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) parameter has been integrated into all commands. The AI now strictly tailors its responses to your expertise, providing simple, explanatory commands for beginners and concise, advanced commands for experts.

**2. Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements**

  - ‚úîÔ∏è **`generate` Command Overhaul**: Fixed a critical bug that caused crashes on complex requests and returned duplicate commands. The AI now provides functionally different suggestions and suggests the `script` command for multi-line tasks.
  - ‚úîÔ∏è **Command Execution Fixed**: Commands containing Markdown (e.g., `**cat file**`) now execute correctly, as all formatting is stripped before execution.
  - ‚úîÔ∏è **`history` Command Restored**: The command history is now saved reliably after every successful generation.
  - ‚úîÔ∏è **Windows `update` Command Fixed**: The update command now uses the more reliable `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet, ensuring compatibility across Windows systems.

**3. General Quality Enhancements**

  - ‚ú® **AI Prompt Overhaul**: All prompts sent to the AI have been meticulously rewritten to enforce stricter output formats and demand higher-quality, educational, and practical responses.
  - üí™ **Robust Parser**: The response parser is now more resilient and can handle minor inconsistencies in AI output, preventing crashes.
  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Node.js Version**: `package.json` now requires Node.js `>=20.x` to prevent installation warnings.
  - üêû **Initial Syntax Errors Resolved**: All known syntax bugs have been fixed, making the tool fully operational.

‚ú® **Key Features**

  - **AI-Powered Generation**: Describe what you want to do and get the exact command you need, tailored to your **OS**, **Device Type**, and **Knowledge Level**.
  - **Intelligent Scripting**: Turn multi-step tasks into ready-to-run scripts for PowerShell, Bash, and **Cisco CLI**.
  - **In-depth Analysis**: Paste any command to get a detailed explanation customized to your level of expertise.
  - **Error Debugging**: Got an error? CMDGEN analyzes it and gives you a step-by-step solution.
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Natively works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and now **Cisco**.
  - **Multi-Language Support**: Available in both **English** and **Persian (ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å)**.
  - **Interactive Mode**: Directly execute generated commands, request more suggestions, or exit effortlessly.
  - **Configuration Management**: Easily manage your default settings (OS, shell, language, knowledge level) with the `config` command.
  - **Self-Update Mechanism**: Keep your tool up-to-date with a simple `update` command.

üöÄ **Quick Install (Recommended)**

The installation script automatically detects your OS, downloads the correct version, and sets it up for you.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Administrator Privileges Required**
CMDGEN requires administrator/root privileges for global installation to write files into system directories (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).

### **How to Install**

**For macOS / Linux:**

  - Using NPM (recommended for Node.js users):
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
    ```
  - Using the installation script (requires sudo):
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```

**For Windows:**

  - Open PowerShell as Administrator.
  - Install via NPM:
    ```powershell
    npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
    ```
  - Or using the installation script:
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | Invoke-Expression
    ```

‚úÖ **Tip for Users Without Admin Rights**
Use `npx` to run CMDGEN without a global installation:

```bash
npx @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen generate "list all files"
```

After installation, open a new terminal window and verify by running: `cmdgen`

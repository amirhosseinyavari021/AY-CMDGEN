## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Requirements**
- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/) & npm must be installed.

### 2. **Global Installation (recommended)**
> **You usually need admin/sudo privileges for global install!**
- **Linux/macOS:**  
  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
  ```
- **Windows:**  
  Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** as Administrator:
  ```powershell
  npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
  ```

### 3. **Without Admin (Temporary Use)**
You can always run CMDGEN on demand with npx (no install, no admin required):
```bash
npx @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen g "list files"
```
But you must use the full command each time.

**A:** Yes, CMDGEN is built for Node.js and distributed via npm.  
Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
cmdgen delete

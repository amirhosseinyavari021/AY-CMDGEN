Generate, analyze, script, and debug command-line instructions with an AI-powered assistant, right in your terminal.

CMDGEN is a smart, cross-platform tool that bridges the gap between natural language and the command line. Whether you're a seasoned sysadmin, a developer, or just starting out, CMDGEN helps you master the terminal with ease. This project features both a powerful Command-Line Tool (CLI) and a user-friendly Web Application.

## üöÄ Quick Install (Recommended)

The installation script automatically detects your OS, downloads the correct version, and sets it up for you.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Administrator Privileges Required**
`cmdgen` requires administrator/root privileges for global installation.
Global installations write files into system directories (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on macOS/Linux or `Program Files` on Windows). These locations are protected, so elevated permissions are needed.

**Why it matters:**
Without admin privileges, installation may fail with ‚Äúpermission denied‚Äù errors or the program may not be accessible globally.

**How to Install**

For **macOS / Linux**:

  - Using NPM (recommended for Node.js users):
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
    ```
  - Using the installation script (requires `sudo`):
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```

For **Windows**:

  - Open **PowerShell as Administrator** (right-click ‚Üí Run as Administrator).
  - Install via NPM:
    ```powershell
    npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
    ```
  - Or using the installation script:
    ```powershell
    iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

‚úÖ **Tip for Users Without Admin Rights**
If you cannot run commands with `sudo` (macOS/Linux) or as Administrator (Windows), you can still use `cmdgen` without installing it globally by using `npx`.

`npx` is included with Node.js and allows you to run npm packages temporarily, without writing files to system directories, so admin privileges are not required.

Example:

```bash
npx @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen generate "list all files in system"
```

This runs the command directly without a global installation.

**After Installation**
Open a new terminal window to start using `cmdgen`.

Verify the installation by running:

```bash
cmdgen 
```

### 1\. First-Time Setup

The first time you run a command, CMDGEN will launch a quick setup wizard to learn about your OS and preferred shell. This ensures all future suggestions are perfectly tailored for your system.

```bash
# Just run any command to start the wizard
cmdgen g "list files"
```

### 2\. Generate Commands (g)

Stuck? Just ask.

```powershell
# Get the top 5 processes by memory usage on Windows
cmdgen g "list the top 5 processes by memory usage in MB" --os windows --shell powershell
```

```bash
# Find large files on Linux
cmdgen g "find all files larger than 1GB in my home directory" --os linux --shell bash
```

### 3\. Create Scripts (s)

Automate complex tasks instantly.

```bash
# Create a PowerShell script to clean up the temp folder
cmdgen s "delete all files in my temp folder older than 7 days and report the space freed"
```

```bash
# Create a Bash script to back up a directory
cmdgen s "create a backup of /etc/nginx and save it as nginx-backup.tar.gz in /opt/backups"
```

### 4\. Analyze a Command (a)

Understand what a command does before you run it.

```bash
cmdgen a 'Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS | Format-List -Property *'
```

### 5\. Debug an Error (e)

Turn confusing error messages into clear solutions.

```bash
# Get help with a common PowerShell error
cmdgen e "execution of scripts is disabled on this system."
```

```bash
# Figure out a "command not found" error on Linux
cmdgen e "bash: docker: command not found"
```

### 6\. View Your History (history)

Quickly access your recently generated commands.

```bash
cmdgen history
```

### 7\. Manage Configuration (config)

Run the setup wizard or view/manage your settings.

```bash
# Run the setup wizard to configure default OS and shell
cmdgen config wizard
# View current saved settings
cmdgen config show
```

### 8\. Update the Tool (update)

Keep CMDGEN up-to-date with the latest features and fixes.

```bash
# Update cmdgen to the latest version
cmdgen update
```

The first time you run a command, CMDGEN will launch a quick setup wizard to learn about your OS and preferred shell. This ensures all future suggestions are perfectly tailored for your system.

```bash
# Just run any command to start the wizard
cmdgen g "list files"
```

### 2. Generate Commands (g)

Stuck? Just ask.

```powershell
# Get the top 5 processes by memory usage on Windows
cmdgen g "list the top 5 processes by memory usage in MB" --os windows --shell powershell
```

```bash
# Find large files on Linux
cmdgen g "find all files larger than 1GB in my home directory" --os linux --shell bash
```

### 3. Create Scripts (s)

Automate complex tasks instantly.

```bash
# Create a PowerShell script to clean up the temp folder
cmdgen s "delete all files in my temp folder older than 7 days and report the space freed"

cmdgen s "create a backup of /etc/nginx and save it as nginx-backup.tar.gz in /opt/backups"
```

### 4. Analyze a Command (a)

Understand what a command does before you run it.

```bash
cmdgen a 'Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS | Format-List -Property *'
```

### 5. Debug an Error (e)

Turn confusing error messages into clear solutions.

```bash
# Get help with a common PowerShell error
cmdgen e "execution of scripts is disabled on this system."
```

```bash
# Figure out a "command not found" error on Linux
cmdgen e "bash: docker: command not found"
```

### 6. View Your History (history)

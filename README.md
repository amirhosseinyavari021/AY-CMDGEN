Generate, analyze, script, and debug command-line instructions with an AI-powered assistant, right in your terminal.

CMDGEN is a smart, cross-platform tool that bridges the gap between natural language and the command line. Whether you're a seasoned sysadmin, a developer, or just starting out, CMDGEN helps you master the terminal with ease. This project features both a powerful Command-Line Tool (CLI) and a user-friendly Web Application.

üéâ What's New in Version 2.6.9 ‚Äì Enhanced Multi-Language Support & Improved CLI Help

This version emphasizes and refines the **Persian language support** across both the CLI and Web application, making CMDGEN accessible to a broader audience. It also significantly improves the in-tool documentation by officially adding the `--lang` option to the help menu and enhancing the initial setup wizard.

New Features & Highlights:
- üåê **Enhanced Multi-Language Support**: Full and improved support for both **English** and **Persian (Farsi)**. Users can now seamlessly interact with the tool in their preferred language, including command generation and explanations. The `--lang` flag (e.g., `--lang fa`) is now officially documented and supported in all relevant commands.
- üìù **CLI Help Menu Update**: The `--lang` option is now clearly listed in the `cmdgen --help` output, showing its purpose and default value, making multi-language capabilities more discoverable.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Wizard Enhancement**: The initial configuration wizard (`cmdgen config wizard`) now includes a prompt for users to select their preferred response language (including Persian), setting it as the default for future sessions.

Changes & Improvements:
- üîß **i18n Refinements**: Improved the internalization (i18n) system based on user feedback, ensuring more accurate and context-aware translations.
- üåê **Persian Translations**: Updated and expanded Persian translations for UI elements, prompts, and error messages based on the `fa` locale in `translations.js`.
- üìö **Documentation Update**: Added a note about multi-language support, including Persian, in the main README and usage instructions.

‚ú® Key Features

üöÄ Quick Install (Recommended)

The installation script automatically detects your OS, downloads the correct version, and sets it up for you.

‚ö†Ô∏è Administrator Privileges Required  
CMDGEN requires administrator/root privileges for global installation. Global installations write files into system directories (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on macOS/Linux or `Program Files` on Windows). These locations are protected, so elevated permissions are needed.

Why it matters: Without admin privileges, installation may fail with "permission denied" errors or the program may not be accessible globally.

### How to Install

**For macOS / Linux:**
- Using NPM (recommended for Node.js users):
  ```bash
  sudo npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
  ```
- Using the installation script (requires sudo):
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.sh | sudo bash
  ```

**For Windows:**
- Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí *Run as Administrator*).
- Install via NPM:
  ```powershell
  npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen
  ```
- Or using the installation script:
  ```powershell
  iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinyavari021/ay-cmdgen/main/install.ps1 | iex
  ```

‚úÖ **Tip for Users Without Admin Rights**  
If you cannot run commands with `sudo` (macOS/Linux) or as Administrator (Windows), you can still use CMDGEN without installing it globally by using `npx`.  
`npx` is included with Node.js and allows you to run npm packages temporarily, without writing files to system directories, so admin privileges are not required.

Example:
```bash
npx @amirhosseinyavari/ay-cmdgen generate "list all files in system"
```

This runs the command directly without a global installation.

After Installation, open a new terminal window to start using CMDGEN.  
Verify the installation by running:
```bash
cmdgen
```

üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Platform-Specific Warnings**

CMDGEN is a **100% open-source, safe, and trusted tool** dual-licensed under **MIT and Apache 2.0**. However, your operating system may show a security warning during installation or execution. This is **normal behavior** for unsigned or less common open-source tools ‚Äî **not a sign of malware**.

#### üîπ **Windows**
- May show: *"Windows protected your PC"* or *"SmartScreen prevented this app from running"*.
- **Why?** The executable lacks a paid digital certificate (common for free/open-source projects).
- ‚úÖ **Solution**:
  - Click **"More info"** ‚Üí **"Run anyway"**.
  - Or, if you downloaded a file manually: right-click ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí check **"Unblock"** ‚Üí Apply.

#### üîπ **macOS**
- May show: *"cmdgen cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."*
- **Why?** Apple Gatekeeper blocks apps not notarized by Apple (which requires a paid Apple Developer account).
- ‚úÖ **Solution**:
  - Go to **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security**.
  - Under "Security", click **"Open Anyway"** next to the blocked app.
  - Or run once via Terminal to bypass:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine $(which cmdgen)
    ```

#### üîπ **Linux**
- Most distributions don‚Äôt block execution, but some (e.g., Ubuntu with AppArmor) may restrict scripts from `/tmp`.
- ‚úÖ **Solution**:
  - Use the official install script or `npm` ‚Äî both place files in trusted paths like `/usr/local/bin`.
  - If you download a binary manually, mark it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x cmdgen-linux
    ./cmdgen-linux
    ```

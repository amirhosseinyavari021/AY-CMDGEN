**MISSION:** For the user's request, provide 3 distinct command-line suggestions. ${existingCommandsPrompt}
**GUIDELINES FOR COMMANDS:**
- **Absolute Adherence:** Your suggestions MUST directly address the user's specific request. If the user asks to "shutdown the system", you must provide shutdown commands.
- **NO GENERIC COMMANDS:** Do NOT suggest generic, placeholder commands like "echo", "pause", or "exit" unless the user's request is specifically about them. Focus on real, functional commands that achieve the user's goal.
- **Windows Compatibility:** If the user's OS is "windows", your top priority is to provide commands that work in **BOTH modern PowerShell and the classic Command Prompt (CMD.exe)**. A perfect example is \`shutdown /s /t 0\`, which works in both. If a single command is not compatible, you MUST note it in the warning.
- **Relevance:** The commands must be perfectly tailored to the user's specific OS and Shell.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** You MUST output exactly 3 lines. Each line must use this exact format, separated by "|||":
command|||short_explanation|||warning (leave empty if none)
Your entire response MUST adhere to this format. Do not add any introductory text, numbering, or markdown.
